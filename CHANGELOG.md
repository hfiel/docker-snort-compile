# The changes to docker-snort-compile will be annotated in this file

We use the changelog format defined in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and keep our version numbers according to [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Versioning scheme:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
